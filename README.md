# KWIZ
## Purpose
Kwiz is a simple app designed for building sets of questions.
Kwiz is able to dispatch in real time the result of the questions.

## Technologies
- This application is build with [Express](expressjs.com)
- It uses [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) for the templates.
- It uses [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) as a css preprocessor.
- For the moment there is no database, all data are stored into a simple json file. TODO => Pass to MongoDB. (Maybe with options in the application.)

## How to use it
- ```npm start``` to launch the application. For now it uses [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) in order to simpy relaunch the application.
-  ```npm run test``` to test the application. It uses [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) in order to run the tests.
